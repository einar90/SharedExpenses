I wanted an app that lets me add an expense with as few taps as possible. So I made one.\r\n\r\n### Minimal configuration\r\nThe only configuration needed is entering the names of the two persons who will be sharing expenses. When this is done the names will appear on two separate buttons.\r\n\r\n### One-tap adding of expenses\r\nWhen you want to add an expense you simply enter the amount paid, and tap the name of the person who paid it.\r\n\r\n![A screenshot showing some example data.](http://folk.ntnu.no/einarjba/sharedExpensesScreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Planned features\r\n\r\n### Logo\r\nThe app will eventually have one.\r\n\r\n### Editing and deleting entries\r\nAt the moment there is no way to edit or delete existing entries; this will be added soon. In the mean time you can adjust the balance by adding fictitious purchases for the person you want to reduce the debt for.\r\n\r\n### Expense comments\r\nThe possibility add comments to entries will be added. This will probably be done by tapping the item in the log. \r\n\r\n### Ability to synchronize across two different devices\r\nI plan to add an option to synchronize the data across two different devices, to that both people involved can add new purchases.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
