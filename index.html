        <h2>A simpler way to track shared expenses</h2>

<p>Most tracking apps for tracking joint expenses have a lot of features -- too many for my own liking. I wanted an app that lets me add an expense with as few taps as possible. So I made one.</p>

<h3>Minimal configuration</h3>

<p>The only configuration needed is entering the names of the two persons who will be sharing expenses. When this is done the names will appear on two separate buttons.</p>

<h3>One-tap adding of expenses</h3>

<p>When you want to add an expense you simply enter the amount paid, and tap the name of the person who paid it.</p>

<h2>Planned features</h2>

<h3>Logo</h3>

<p>The app will eventually have one.</p>

<h3>Editing and deleting entries</h3>

<p>At the moment there is no way to edit or delete existing entries; this will be added soon. In the mean time you can adjust the balance by adding fictitious purchases for the person you want to reduce the debt for.</p>

<h3>Expense comments</h3>

<p>The possibility add comments to entries will be added. This will probably be done by tapping the item in the log. </p>

<h3>Ability to synchronize across two different devices</h3>

<p>I plan to add an option to synchronize the data across two different devices, to that both people involved can add new purchases.</p>
